# Chat Analyzer

## The problem it solves
Chat Analyzer is an AI software solution to help organizations measure both sentiment and engagement on their chat platforms. This software takes text-based chat conversation data and finds out an individual’s emotions toward a particular topic. It also allows users to identify common words used, the frequency of conversation, and how much the active person was in the conversation.
This chat analyzer can be utilized for different purposes including customer service, employee satisfaction, better decision-making, and market planning. It helps businesses to gain insight from their customers by identifying their interests and feelings towards certain topics. With this data, companies can make better business decisions by understanding the customers’ needs more effectively.

## Challenges we ran into
Building Chat Analyzer was a challenging task. One of the bugs we initially ran into was related to data visualization. By creating the logic to display the data in an intuitive and comprehensive way, we were able to resolve that issue. Also, because the system was connected to databases from different sources, we had to implement deployable solutions for data normalization and cleansing for accurate results. With proper debugging and testing, we ensured that all components of the system functioned properly without any errors.
